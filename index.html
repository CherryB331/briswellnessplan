   <section><p>When it comes to wellness, everyone has a different interpretation of it.
    Different goals or methods that they think are the best for them. That used to be me. Now 
    I'm a different person compared to who I was 2 years ago. I will need to try different things to
   know what works best. Here's the plan that I have created that works for current me:

    <section> <h2>Diet</h2>
    <p>One of the key factors in your overall wellbeing is the fuel that you use to power through the day.
      It's very important to eat foods that are nutrient dense and increases your energy levels. I know 
      that sounds easy to do on paper, but what about reality? No one really has the perfect meal for each day.
  </p>
  <h2>Exercise</h2>
<p> Exercise is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Moving your body to promote healthier habits is a great 
  way to influence your habits changing. But its hard. Do I have to do 100 sit ups a day? Do I need to run 5 miles after 
  my 9 to 5? When it comes to excersie, it's all so overwhelming.
  <h3>I'm going to make a plan for myself that is sustainable. Something that will challenge me, but not scare me away.</h3>

<h2>Sleep</h2>
<p>I strive to get my beauty sleep. I give myself a strict bedtime, and I set my alarm to ring before the sun. But do 
  I stick with it? Sometimes, but the day just gets away from me. I find myself scrolling until 1am. When I finally get to sleep,
  that alarm rings me awake. And I fin myselfing starting my day already in a bad spot.
</p>
<h2>Mental Health</h2>
<p>Healthy habits create a healthy mind. I find myself scrolling on TikTok for hours trying to find a new hobby that 
  promotes my brain health. I pick it up for 2 days, and then I drop it. It's frustrating trying to be productive in 
  a state of uncertainty.

<h3>I want a schedule that works best for me and my lifestyle. I want to adopt hobbies that I won't quit when it gets difficult.</h3>
