<p class="background">
  <ol>
  <li><h4>Cooking after a long day of work.</h4></li>
  <ul><li>Prepping all 3 meals in advance. I've tried it before, and I feel that that was the best way to go.</li></ul>
  <li><h4>Forgetting my lunch at home.</h4></li>
  <ul><li>I live pretty close to my work, so if I forget my lunch, I can just simply go and get it.</li></ul>
  <li><h4>DoorDash TM and UberEats TM</h4></li>
  <ul><li>Limit the use of delivery services. But if I find myself ordering, I will order from places that have healthier options.</li></ul>

      <h3 class="change">These goals seem to look difficult to achieve. But with an effective schedule, it can be possible. I will lay out my schedule:</h3>

      <ol> 
      <li><h4>Walk 10,000 steps a day</h4></li>
    <ul>
      <li>Walk 3,000 steps in the morning</li>
    <li>Walk 2,000 steps during work</li>
  <li> Walk 2,000 steps during lunch</li>
<li>Walk 3,000 steps in the evening</li>
</ul>
<li><h4>Do 20 minutes of Barre every weekday</h4></li>
<ul>
  <li>Every morning, pull up a 20 minute full body barre workout video</li>
</ul>
<li><h4>Do 10 minutes of core workouts every weekday</h4></li>
<ul>
  <li>Every evening, pull up a 10 minute core workout video</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<h3 class="change">The main reason why I decided on these specific workouts is because they are all focused on form. I want to improve my posture
  and balance. I work at an office job, so doing workouts that centers my core and posture will help me the most.

<h3 class="center"> This workout plan is more difficult to keep up with. This is why I have a set schedule to 
  make it easier to follow. I will also help with building a routine.</h3>
