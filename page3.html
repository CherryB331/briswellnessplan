      <li>Set a strict bedtime and wake up time.</li>
      <li>Wear an eye mask to limit light exposure.</li>
        <li>Read before bed</li></ol></section>
      <section><h3>These goals are achievable, I am not too stressed about my sleeping habits. I have turned a lot of these goals into habits. I will now show how 
        I will continue to keep these habits going:</h3>

          <li>Calculate 8 hours of sleep based on the wake up time.</li>
          <li>Drink a cup of hot water with lemon as soon as I wake up.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Keep the eye mask on my pillow to remind me to wear it.</li>

        <li><h4>Read before bed</h4></li>
        <ul><li>Keep a book by my bedside to read before sleep.</li></ul></ol></p></section></article>
        
        <h3>I do most of these habits consistently. None of these habits are too difficult for me to maintain. I will just be adding another habit to my routine. Now it's time to focus on my mental health:</h3>

    <ul><li>I will use a meditation app, since this is new to me.</li></ul>
    <li><h4>Give myself grace.</h4></li>
