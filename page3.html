        <h3 class="correct">Sleeping is very important for your overall health. You can be doing everything right, but if you don't get a good nights rest,
        it could affect your entire day. Here's my plan for better sleep:</h3>
    <section>
      <h4><ol class="shrink">
      <li>Set a strict bedtime and wake up time.</li>
      <li>Wear an eye mask to limit light exposure.</li>
        <li>Read before bed</li>
      </ol></h4>
    </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="correct">These goals are achievable, I am not too stressed about my sleeping habits. I have turned a lot of these goals into habits. I will now show how 
        I will continue to keep these habits going:</h3>
      <p >
       <ol class="shrink">
        <li><h4>Set a strict bedtime and wake up time. </h4></li>
        <ul>
          <li>I will set an alarm on my phone at the same time every morning.</li>
          <li>Calculate 8 hours of sleep based on the wake up time.</li>
          <li>Drink a cup of hot water with lemon as soon as I wake up.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Wear an eye mask to limit light exposure.</h4></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep the eye mask on my pillow to remind me to wear it.</li>
          <li>Wear castor oil on my eyelashes before bed.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><h4>Read before bed</h4></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep a book by my bedside to read before sleep.</li>

        <h3 class="correct">I do most of these habits consistently. None of these habits are too difficult for me to maintain. I will just be adding another habit to my routine. Now it's time to focus on my mental health:</h3>

      <h3 class="correct">Mental health is just as important as physical health. I feel like the biggest helper to all of habit building is discipline. I will need to strengthen my mind. Here are my goals:</h3>
 <h4>
  <ol class="shrink">
  <li>Keep a positive mindset.</li>
<li>Spend 10 minutes each day meditating.</li>
<li>Give myself grace</li>
</ol>
 </h4>
<section>
  <h3 class="correct">These goals look easy at first, but the mind works in mysterious ways. I will need to be patient with myself. Here's the ways
  I will prioiritize these goals:</h3>
  <p>
    <ol class="shrink">
    <li><h4>Keep a positive mindset.</h4></li>
    <ul>
      <li>When I'm doing workouts that are hard, I need to remember that it's part of the process.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h4>Spend 10 minutes each day meditating.</h4></li>
    <ul>
      <li>I will use a meditation app, since this is new to me.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><h4>Give myself grace.</h4></li>
    <ul>
      <li>When I make mistakes, I will remind myself that it's part of the journey.</li>
